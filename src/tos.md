**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THE TERMS SET FORTH, OR ANY SUBSEQUENT MODIFICATION THEREOF, DO NOT PARTICIPATE OR CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN DIGIXDAO.**

**Purpose**. DigixDAO is a suite of smart contracts created by DG which is built on the Ethereum blockchain (together with the website, APIs, any associated websites or mobile applications, “**DigixDAO**”). DigixDAO is meant as a platform to allow grants to be released to eligible Users in a decentralised manner to execute projects created on DigixDAO (“**Projects**”). DGD Tokens are used to participate in DigixDAO. As these Terms will govern each your participation in DigixDAO, you should take the time to read these Terms carefully before you decide to participate in DigixDAO.

**Amendments to DigixDAO**. DG reserves the right to make amendments to these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion (“**Amendments**”). The Amendments will be posted on DigixDAO and communicated by updating the date of update above. Your electronic acceptance of these Terms and/or continued participation in DigixDAO after the Amendments have been made will constitute your consent to the modified Terms and/or all relevant changes to DigixDAO thereof. You should take the time to read these Terms carefully each time you use DigixDAO.

**Compliance**. By participating in DigixDAO, you agree that it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all Applicable Laws in your local jurisdiction relating to your participation in DigixDAO.

**B. IMPORTANT RISKS**

This section highlights certain risks that we would like to bring to your attention before you participate in DigixDAO. The risks highlighted in this section are not meant to be exhaustive and are set out for your consideration only. In addition to the risks highlighted in this section, there may be other risks not included herein, arising either now or in the future, which could be relevant to your participation in DigixDAO. By participating in DigixDAO, you acknowledge that you understand the costs, risks and/or losses which may occur pursuant to your participation.

**Valuation Risk**. Virtual currencies and digital tokens are not legal tender nor backed by any government. Where fiat currencies are backed by their respective governments and/or central banks, virtual currencies and digital tokens rely on the networks and protocols on which they run, as well as the participants in such networks and protocols (“**Protocols**”). The potential for forks in such Protocols could divide market participants, increase the total supply of virtual currencies and digital tokens and/or render such virtual currencies and digital tokens obsolete. The value of virtual currencies and digital tokens may also depend on the liquidity and spread on the markets and/or exchanges which such virtual currencies and digital tokens are traded. Such markets and/or exchanges may not be regulated by any regulatory authority, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The values of virtual currencies and digital tokens are also highly speculative and the traded price may fluctuate greatly within a short period of time, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. As the risk of loss in virtual currencies and digital tokens can be substantial, you should exercise caution and carefully consider whether purchasing and/or holding virtual currencies and digital tokens is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.

**Transaction Risk**. Generally, transactions in virtual currencies and digital tokens are irreversible and losses due to erroneous or fraudulent transactions may not be recoverable. Transactions in virtual currencies and digital tokens are also generally anonymous, which may make it difficult to identify malicious actors. Completing transactions of virtual currencies and digital tokens may also depend on the number of pending transactions on the Protocols on which they run. If the Ethereum blockchain (which is the blockchain powering DigixDAO) is congested, your transactions, including any interactions with DigixDAO, may be delayed for an undetermined period of time. Such risk of delay may increase in the event more smart contracts are on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Custody Risk**. In the event your virtual currencies and digital tokens are stored using third-party wallet providers, custody services and/or exchanges (“**Third-Party Custody Services**”), losses may occur in the form of theft, hacks, unauthorised disclosures and/or other compromises affecting the underlying infrastructure of such Third-Party Custody Services. You may also lose access to your virtual currencies and digital tokens if you do not have security over your private key or if the operations of the Third-Party Custody Services are suspended or ceased. Events which occur in relation to such Third-Party Custody Services are not within our control and we are not under any obligation to assist, or may not be able to assist, in the event you suffer from losses due to compromises affecting the security of such Third-Party Custody Services. You should take utmost care in the custody of your private key.

**Lock-Up Risk**. In order to participate in DigixDAO, you are required to lock DGD Tokens in DigixDAO over a specific period (“**Lock-Up Period**”). Due to the mechanics built into the DigixDAO smart contracts, once your DGD Tokens are locked, you can only unlock them during a designated period in the timeline of DigixDAO, which is in effect over a continuous 10 calendar day period occurring approximately once every 90 calendar days (“**Locking Phase**”). During the Lock-Up Period, you will lose access to your locked DGD Tokens, which will prevent you from transferring your DGD Tokens out of DigixDAO. As the Lock-Up Period is part of the smart contracts that run DigixDAO, we do not have custody or control over your DGD Tokens and we are not under any obligation to assist, or we may not be able to assist, if you request to unlock your DGD Tokens during the Lock-Up Period. We are not responsible for losses or any special, incidental or consequential damages you may suffer resulting from locking your DGD Tokens in DigixDAO. You should take time to consider carefully before you decide to lock DGD Tokens in DigixDAO.

**Regulatory Risk**. Regulatory frameworks and regimes in relation to virtual currencies and digital tokens are in constant development and may differ based on jurisdiction. It is possible that your participation in DigixDAO may be limited by and subject to, now or in the future, such laws, rules and regulations and the relevant amendments thereto, from time to time.

Each of the Parties hereby agrees as follows:

By locking your DGDs in DigixDAO, to the extent permitted by any Applicable Laws, you hereby waive all claims and liability against DG in connection with locking your DGD Tokens in DigixDAO.

**2.5 Trading DGDs on Secondary Market.** DGD Tokens are currently tradable on various third-party cryptocurrency exchanges and secondary markets (“**Secondary Market**”).

DGD Badges which are not used to redeem Reputation Points are transferable from one Address to another Address.
