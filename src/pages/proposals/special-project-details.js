      <h1>Configuration change - Shortening Voting Durations for voting rounds</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Preamble</h2>
      <br />
      We have decided to submit a project to change certain configurations of the DigixDAO platform
      to improve efficiency of the governance process and encourage more participation.
      <br />
      <br />
      In short, we are proposing to shorten the durations for the different types of voting that can
      occur on the platform.
      <br />
      <br />
      This would allow for faster rejection / approval of projects, which could help the proposer
      better plan and allocate his time / resources to their projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <br />
      The current configuration of the voting durations is as such:
      <br />
      &emsp;- A Moderator voting round takes 10 days
      <br />
      &emsp;- A Participant voting round takes 14 days of Commit phase and 7 days of Reveal phase
      <br />
      &emsp;- A Special Projectâ€™s voting round takes 28 days of Commit phase and 7 days of Reveal
      phase
      <br />
      &emsp;- There needs to be a buffer of at least 10 days from the end of the voting rounds to
      the end of the quarter, for the proposer to claim the result of the voting.
      <br />
      <br />
      With this current configuration, as has been raised by some in the community, the voting
      rounds are seemingly longer than needed, which lead to some concerns:
      <br />
      &emsp;- It delays the funding for projects that would pass. Even if a project receives a huge
      amount of support from the community, it will still have to wait at least 31 days to get its
      funding.
      <br />
      &emsp;- There is a situation where projects have to finalise before day 49 in the quarter, to
      be funded in the same quarter (due to long voting periods). This is because there needs to be
      a minimum of 41 days left in the quarter for all the voting to complete. These 41 days consist
      of 10 days of Moderator voting round, 21 days of Participant voting round and 10 days buffer
      for claiming voting result.
      <br />
      <br />
      As such, we are proposing to shorten the voting periods for the following voting rounds:
      <br />
      &emsp;- Participant voting round: from 14 days of Commit phase + 7 days of Reveal phase to 10
      days of Commit phase + 5 days of Reveal phase.
      <br />
      &emsp;- Special Project voting round: from 28 days of Commit phase + 7 days of Reveal phase to
      14 days of Commit phase + 7 days of Reveal phase
      <br />
      &emsp;- Buffer for claiming voting results: from 10 days to 7 days
      <br />
      <br />
      With these changes in place, proposers can expect to receive their funding 25 days (instead of
      31 days) after they finalise their project, and they will have until day 58 to finalise their
      project to be able to receive funding in the same quarter. We believe that these new durations
      are more reasonable and would make the project filtering process more efficient in DigixDAO.
      <br />
      <br />
      If approved, the changes proposed by this Special Project will only take effects in Quarter 2.
      Hence, voting durations in Quarter 1 will still remain the same regardless.
      <br />
      <br />
      As for the voting process for this Special Project, it follows a Commit and Reveal scheme that
      is similar to a Participant voting round. If you have any problems or questions, do contact us
      via the Help button below or raise the issue in room dgdao-help in our discord channel.
